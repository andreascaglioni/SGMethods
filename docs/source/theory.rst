Theory of sparse grid interpolation
====================================

Basic explenations on sparse grid interpolation are coming soon.

In the meantime, you can check the following publications by the author of this
package and collaborators:

* A Peer-review paper on the adaptive sparse grid-finite elements approximation
  of the random diffusion Poisson problem:
  :cite:`Feischl2021Convergence`; 

* A preprint on the approximation of the Stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert 
  problem with a-priori determined sparse grid and rates of convergence:
  :cite:`an2024sparse`.
  The sparse grid (equivalently, the multi-index set) of the interpolant is 
  determined based on a general theory we developed to analyze the regularity of
  nonlinear parametric PDEs with Gaussian noise;

* The (soon to be published) PhD thesis, which comprises the previous two 
  papers, some theoretical extensions, and more comments on SGMethods:
  :cite:`scaglioni2024thesis`.
