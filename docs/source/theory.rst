Theory of sparse grid interpolation
====================================

Basic explenations on sparse grid interpolation are coming soon.

In the meantime, you can check the following publications by the author of this
package and collaborators:

* A Peer-review paper on a method that combines adaptive sparse grid 
    interpolation and adaptive finite elements approximation:
    :cite:`Feischl2021Convergence`; 

* A preprint on the approximation of the Stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert 
    problem with a-priori determined sparse grid and rates of convergence:
    :cite:`an2024sparse`; 

* The (soon to be published) PhD thesis, which comprises the previous two 
    papers, some theoretical extensions, and more comments about SGMethods:
    :cite:`scaglioni2024thesis`.
